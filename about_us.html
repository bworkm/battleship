            <h3 class="floatR">My name is Brian Workman. I have been in the IT field since high school when I learned to write Turbo Pascal. I managed the secret LAN onboard the USS Abraham Lincoln for several years. I worked at Microsoft for the past 10 years as an Operations Engineer where I managed the deployments of websites and worked on server side issues.  It's about time I try my hand at development and this is by far the coolest project (so far) that I have been a part of.</h3>

            <h3>Served in the Air Force for 8 years as an AC-130 Gunship mechanic. After living in The South for 30 years, I felt I needed to spread my wings and made the move to Seattle to attend Code Fellows to pursue a long-time interest of mine.  I've always had fascination for war, history, and am an avid fan of war documentaries and movies, especially WW2. So this project was a combination of two of my favorite things. I just love war....jk.</h3>

            <h3>Hi! My name is Juan Chaves. I am originally from the beautiful island of Puerto Rico but moved to Washington State while serving in the Army. I recently got out of active service, where I did some Operations, Training, Human Resources, and Satellite Communications/IT work. Now I'm very motivated training to code. This project has been a blast and I think as a team we executed this project fairly well.</h3>
